    },
    {
      question: "Can AI read my thoughts?",
      answer: "Not yet, but it's working on a stand-up comedy routine based on your browser history. Prepare for some awkward moments at your next family gathering!"

      question: "Is it true that AI will one day rule the world?",

      question: "Will AI-powered virtual assistants become our new best friends?",
      answer: "Absolutely! Who wouldn't want a friend that never gets tired of hearing about your day, doesn't eat the last slice of pizza, and can calculate the tip at restaurants with lightning speed?"
    },
    {
      question: "Can AI predict the future?",
